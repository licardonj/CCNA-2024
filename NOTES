Day 2:
TASK 2: Cisco and DNS using POWERSHELL
TASK 3: Mastering IPV4 and IPV6
  Step 1: CHANGE YOUR BRAIN.
Pera              IPv4                            IPv6
0-9               0-255                           0-9,a-f
7999              7.255.255.255                   :7fff:          -1
8000              8.0.0.0                         :8000:
8001              8.0.0.1                         :8001:          +1

9999              9.255.255.255                   :fff:           -1
1000              10.0.0.0                        :1000:
1001              10.0.0.1                        :1001:          +1

TASK 4: HOW TO SUBNET?
RIVAN METIOD: = 3Secs
CSI= ConvertIT, SubtractIT, IpasokSaHiwaMasikip
10.0.0.0/8 -> 16,777,214 user can be accomodate
172.16.0.0/16 -> 65,534 user can be accomodate
192.168.0.0/24 -> 254 user can be accomodate

Ex1.DESIGN A NETWORK USING SUBNETTING FOR Accenture.com with 1500 Agents,TL's,PMs:
ConvertToBits: 1500 is Bits = 11b
Subtract/32: /-32 - /11 = /21 is | 3rd,8i
IPasokSaHiwa: Ipasok si 8i sa 3rd
Accenture.com: 10.0.8.0/21
1stIP: 10.0.8.1/21
LastIP:10.0.15.255/21
Not: 10.0.16.0/21
_____________________________
DAY 3: IPv4 subnetting in RealWorld/Exam.
"The 5 Hit Combo!"

1st Combo: Need to know the valid range
2nd Combo: Need to know the broadcast
3rd Combo: Need to know the 1st Valid
4th Combo: Need to know the Host
5th Combo: Need to know the Subnets

STEP 1:/19 -> 3rd , 32i
STEP 2: interogate the 3rd,32i of IP: 10.79.100.69 ask, what 32i? 100 falls: 0,32,64,96

1. Network Address: 10.79.96.0/21
2. 1st Valid Range: 10.79.96.1 - 10.79.127.255
3. Last/bc: 10.79.127.255
4: Hosts lahat? /32 - /? = /19. 13bits, 4000 hosts!
5: Subnets lahat? Orig + /something = /new. /8 + /? = /19,11bits, 1000 subnets

Question 1: 
You found a laptop wiht the IP Address of 10.79.100.69/19. To which department it belongs?
a.Sales      10.79.0.0
b.Marketing  10.79.32.0
c.IT Dept    10.79.64.0
d.Admin      10.79.96.0
